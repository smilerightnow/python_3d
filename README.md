a simple 3d rendering library + simple CAD

## Done:

+ Projection of 3D coordinates to 2D window. 
+ Using the mouse to zoom, pan, rotate on all 3 axis.
+ Selectable points.
+ Simplifying the code as much as possible. Currently, using only tkinter+numpy.

## TODO:

+ adding some CAD functions.
+ Removing numpy and using only built-in tools. :)
